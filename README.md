üìå **Harvard University's CS50P - Intro to Programming with Python**  

## ‚ñå Description
CS50P is Harvard's introduction to **programming using Python**. This course focuses on computational thinking and problem-solving through Python, covering essential programming concepts such as **variables, loops, functions, object-oriented programming, file handling, and regular expressions**.  

I have completed all **problem sets** as a way to practice and improve my **Python skills**, but I have **not yet completed the final project or obtained the certificate**.

## ‚ñå Objectives
‚ñ∏ Learn **Python syntax and fundamentals**  
‚ñ∏ Work with **data structures** (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)  
‚ñ∏ Implement **file handling, CSV, JSON, and APIs**  
‚ñ∏ Explore **object-oriented programming (OOP)**  
‚ñ∏ Understand **unit testing and debugging techniques**  

## ‚ñå Completed Problem Sets
| Topic | Concepts Covered |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Python Basics** | Variables, loops, conditionals, functions |
| **Data Structures** | Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples |
| **File Handling** | Reading/writing files, CSV, JSON |
| **Regular Expressions** | Pattern matching with `re` module |
| **APIs & Web Scraping** | Fetching data from APIs, parsing web pages |
| **Object-Oriented Programming** | Classes, objects, inheritance |
| **Testing & Debugging** | Writing unit tests with `pytest` |

## ‚ñå Final Project (Not Yet Completed)
I have not yet worked on the **final project**, but I may add one in the future.  

## ‚ñå Installation & Usage
